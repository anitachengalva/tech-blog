# Tech Blog

## Description

This project's goal is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The application app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```


## Installation and Usage

In order to run this application, you will want to `git clone` this repository so that the code is on your local machine. Run `npm i` while in the root directory in order to install all necessary [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) dependencies. Then run `npm start` to launch the server.

This application is hosted at Port 3001, so typing: `http://localhost:3001/` into the address bar of your browser (while the server is running) should display the user interface.
